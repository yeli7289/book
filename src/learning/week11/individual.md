# Individual Homework

## Objective

* Add a non-trivial front-end feature to your previous team's together app without
having to modify the Firebase backend

Coming up next week, we will continue this exercise with a requirement to
enhance the Firebase backend as well.

## Grading

Please self-grade. The objective is to demonstrate that you can have a good
assessment of yourself in terms of how well you've learned.

### Criteria

There are three areas you can improve. If you feel you've put in a substantial
enhancement, mark _substantial_. If you feel you have a good understanding
of the code and as a result, you are able to add a good improvement, mark _good_.
If you only put in some minor, cosmetic changes, mark _trivial_.
